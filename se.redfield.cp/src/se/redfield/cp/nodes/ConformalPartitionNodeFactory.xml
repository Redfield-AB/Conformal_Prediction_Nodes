    <name>Conformal Partitioning</name>
    <shortDescription>Splits table into two partitions, with the first adjusted for calibration.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        The input table is split into two partitions for calibration and train data (i.e. row-wise). 
	        The difference to a normal partitioning node is that the calibration set is adjusted to: (largest lower value divisible by 100) -1. 
			The two partitions are available at the
			two output ports. The following options are available in the dialog:
		</intro>
		<option name="Absolute">
			Specify the absolute number of rows in the calibration set (before adjustment). If there are
			less rows than specified here, all rows are entered into the first 
			table, while the second table contains no rows.
		</option>
		<option name="Relative">
			The percentage of the number of rows in the input table that are
			in the calibration set (before adjustment). It must be between 0 and 100, inclusively.
		</option>
        <option name="Take from top">
        	This mode puts the top-most rows 
        	into the calibration set and the remainder in the training set.</option>        
        <option name="Linear sampling">
            This mode always includes the first and the last row and selects the remaining rows linearly over the whole
            table (e.g. every third row). 
        </option>
		<option name="Draw randomly">
			Random sampling of all rows, you may optionally specify a fixed seed (see below).
		</option>
        <option name="Stratified sampling">
            Check this button if you want stratified sampling, i.e. the distribution
            of values in the selected column is (approximately) retained in 
            the output tables. 
            You may optionally specify a fixed seed (see below).
        </option>
        <option name="Use random seed">
            If either random or stratified sampling is selected, you may enter a fixed seed here
            in order to get reproducible results upon re-execution. If you do not specify a seed,
            a new random seed is taken for each execution. 
        </option>

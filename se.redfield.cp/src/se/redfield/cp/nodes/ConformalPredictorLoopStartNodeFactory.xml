        <intro>
        	Splits the input table into three new tables: training, calibration/cross-validation and test.
			First goes training and test split, then the rest of the training table is split into training and calibration/cross-validation.
			The last procedure is repeated several times for every loop iteration. Test set is created only once and always remains the same during all iterations.
        </intro>
        
        
        <option name="Number of cross-validation iterations">
        	Defines the number of training/calibration splits and number of loop iterations.
        </option>
        <option name="Training/Test split">
        	Similar to Partitioning node splits input table into two datasets. This split is done once for all loop iterations.
        </option>
        <option name="Training/Calibration split">
        	Similar to Partitioning node splits training set into two datasets - training and calibration. This split is done for every loop iteration.

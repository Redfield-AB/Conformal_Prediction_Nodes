        <intro>
			Creates a calibration table with ranking for further calibration of the test data sets.
			Ranking is sorting by absolute error (Alpha) provided by predictor nodes in descending order.
			In order to use normalization Prediction Variance or estimate of difficulty - Sigma (needs to be calculated separately)
			should be provided.

        <option name="Target column">
        	A column with target column that is being predicted.
        </option>
        <option name="Use normalization">
        	in order to increase the informativeness, and to potentially minimize prediction regions,
        	it is possible to obtain individual bounds for each sample, which is achieved using a normalized nonconformity function.
        	In order to use normalization Prediction Variance or estimate of difficulty - Sigma (needs to be calculated separately)
        	should be provided. 
        </option>
        <option name="Difficulty column">
        	The column that contains the values defining the Sigma.
        	By default it is advisable to use Prediction Variance values.
        </option>
        <option name="Beta">
        	A sensitivity parameter determining the relative importance of the normalization term.
        </option>
        <option name="Keep All Columns">
        	If checked all columns from input table will be also included into output table along with calibration columns.
        </option>
        <option name="Keep ID column">
        	If checked selected ID column from input table will be included into output table.

    <shortDescription>
        The node returns values from CDF that correspond to provided percentile values.

        <intro>
        	The node returns values from CDF that correspond to provided percentile values,
        	the probabilities of value being within quantiles,
        	less the fixed values and less than test value depending the provided settings.
        	This node is supposed to be used WITH Conformal Calibration and Conformal Prediction loops.

        		The desired percentile cutoff that controls the lower border of the interval from which the predictions could be sampled.
        		The interval is used for estimating the range of possible errors.
        		As the output there will be a calculated probability that the predicted values are
        		higher than the border value corresponding to the percentile.
        		Multiple lower percentiles are allowed, setting the lower interval is optional.

        	<option name="Upper percentiles (%)">
        		The desired percentile cutoff that controls the upper border of the interval from which the predictions could be sampled.
        		The interval is used for estimating the range of possible errors.
        		As the output there will be a calculated probability that the predicted values are
        		lower than the border value corresponding to the percentile.
        		Multiple higher intervals are allowed, setting the upper interval is optional.

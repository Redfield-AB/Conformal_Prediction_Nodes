    	The node returns values from CDF that correspond to provided percentile values.

        <intro>
        	The node returns values from CDF that correspond to provided percentile values,
        	the probabilities of value being within quantiles,
        	less the fixed values and less than test value depending the provided settings.
        </intro>
            
        <option name="Target column (calibration table)">
        	A column with target column that is being predicted.
        </option>
        <option name="Prediction column">
        	A column with predicted values.
        </option>
        <option name="Use normalization">
        	In order to increase the informativeness, and to potentially minimize prediction regions,
        	it is possible to obtain individual bounds for each sample, which is achieved using a normalized nonconformity function.
        	In order to use normalization Prediction Variance or estimate of difficulty - Sigma (needs to be calculated separately)
        	should be provided. 
        </option>
        <option name="Difficulty column">
        	The column that contains the values defining the Sigma.
        	By default it is advisable to use Prediction Variance values.
        </option>
        <option name="Beta">
        	A sensitivity parameter determining the relative importance of the normalization term.
        </option>
        <option name="Keep All Columns">
        	If checked all columns from input table will be also included into output table along with calibration columns.
        </option>
        <option name="Keep ID column">
        	If checked selected ID column from input table will be included into output table.
        </option>
        <option name="Probability distribution column">
        	The column that contains the CDF values for the samples to be predicted.
        </option>
        <option name="Target value">
        	A fixed value to compare prediction with.
			As the output there will be a calculated probability that the predicted values are lower than this fixed value.
        </option>
        <option name="Target column">
        	Column that contains values to compare with (test set).
        	As the output there will be a calculated probability that the predicted values are
        	lower than corresponding values from the selected column.
        </option>
        <option name="Lower percentiles (%)">
        	The desired percentile cutoff that controls the lower border of the interval from which the predictions could be sampled.
        	The interval is used for estimating the range of possible errors.
        	As the output there will be a calculated probability that the predicted values are
        	higher than the border value corresponding to the percentile.
        	Multiple lower percentiles are allowed, setting the lower interval is optional.
        </option>
        <option name="Upper percentiles (%)">
        	The desired percentile cutoff that controls the upper border of the interval from which the predictions could be sampled.
        	The interval is used for estimating the range of possible errors.
        	As the output there will be a calculated probability that the predicted values are
        	lower than the border value corresponding to the percentile.
        	Multiple higher intervals are allowed, setting the upper interval is optional.
